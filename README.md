# microservice-powered-workflows
A Cloud- and Container-Based Approach to Microservices-Powered Workflows  Microservices are independent—sure. Complex transactions and workflows may still require contributions from several microservices. This session describes how microservices can seemingly collaborate without sacrificing their independence. Workflow choreography, rather than orchestration, and events for data exchange, rather than synchronous interactions, are key to implementing workflows in a robust, flexible, and scalable way that can deal with horizontal and stateless and even serverless scalability and continuous, flexible upgrades. Generic capabilities are introduced for monitoring, workflow instance recovery, scheduling, human notifications, and routing slip management. Live demonstrations illustrate and prove the proposed approach.
